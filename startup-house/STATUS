Initialized the website!

Created SVG versions of our background illustrations. Uploaded SVGs to public folder.

Created a StickyBackground component and added event listeners so that the background changes as the user scrolls!

Created a zoom parallax animation! Still need to tweak it.

Made the zoom parallax animation cleaner! Had the idea to incorporate many illustrations of start up houses, and then zoom in on the one that we actually had the chance to visit.

Right now, I'm trying to create sticky text boxes as well as blend the zoom animation with the scrolling background images.
